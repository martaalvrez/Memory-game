# Memory-game
A web project designed to train short-term and working memory through a timed visual memory game.  

The project contains three HTML pages:
**intentoPagWeb.html** — Page with a brief explanation about memory.
**instruccionesJuego.html** — Page with instructions on how to play the game.
**juegoMatriz.html** — Memory game with timers and an interactive grid.

##How the game works:
- A grid appears with 12 random words and numbers 
- You have 15 seconds to memorize the items  
- The grid disappears and an empty one appears  
- You have 60 seconds to type what you remember  
- When time ends or you press **Check**, the game compares your answers with the correct ones 
- An alert shows:  
  **“You got X out of 12 correct!”**
